### Introduction

The topic chosen for this project is Portugal electricity statistics between 1980 and 2021. The data was removed from a Global Electricity Statistics dataset in Kaggle, where only the data relating to Portugal was kept. The dataset is in Time Series format, where the index is the years and the features are the following variables:

* Elec_generation - Electricity generation/production in billion kWh;
* Elec_consumption - Electricity consumption in billion kWh;
* Elec_imports - Electricity imports in billion kWh;
* Elec_exports - Electricity exports in billion kWh;
* Net_imports - Electricity net imports in billion kWh;
* Installed_capacity - The maximum amount of electricity that a generating station can produce in million kW;
* Distribution_loss - Losses that occur in transmission of electricity between the sources of supply and points of distribution in billion kWh.

The problem we want to study is how the electricity consumption has been changing in the period considered. This is an extremely important theme becuase studying it will allow us to predict potential events such as the black out that happened in March 2025. Is the electricity consumption growing beyond the electricity generation?

### Stationarity of the process

Firstly, we need to make sure the variable we are going to study - electricity comsumption - belongs to a stochastic stationary process.

```
eletricity_ds <- read.csv("C:/Users/inesb/Downloads/Portugal_yearly_energy_data.csv")
View(eletricity_ds)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
