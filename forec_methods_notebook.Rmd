The topic chosen for this project is students' mental health, due to it's importance and impact on students' academic success. To study this theme, the chosen dataset was a Student Depression Dataset from Kaggle which contains the following variables:

-   Id - unique identifier assigned to each student record;
-   Gender - gender of the student (e.g., Male, Female, Other);
-   Age - age of the student in years;
-   City - city or region where the student resides;
-   Profession - field of work or study of the student;
-   Academic_pressure - level of pressure the student faces in academic settings in the range from 0 to 5;
-   Work_pressure - level of pressure related to work or job responsibilities in the range from 0 to 5;
-   CGPA - cumulative grade point average of the student in the range from 0 to 10;
-   Study_satisfaction - level of the student’s satisfaction with their studies in the range from 0 to 5;
-   Job_satisfaction - level of the student’s satisfaction with their job or work environment in the range from 0 to 5;
-   Sleep_duration - average number of hours the student sleeps per day out of 4 options;
-   Dietary_habits - assessment of the student’s eating patterns and nutritional habits out of 3 options;
-   Degree - academic degree or program that the student is pursuing;
-   Suicidal_thoughts - binary indicator (Yes/No) that reflects whether the student has ever experienced suicidal ideation;
-   Work_study_hours - average integer number of hours per day the student dedicates to work or study;

Firstly, we need to clean the dataset and to remove

```         
eletricity_ds <- read.csv("C:/Users/inesb/Downloads/Portugal_yearly_energy_data.csv")
View(eletricity_ds)

```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
